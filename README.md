#  Library Management System (C++ CLI Project)

This is a **console-based Library Management System** written in C++ as a self-project by **Ankit**, a student at **IIT Kanpur**. The system is designed to handle basic library operations like managing books, issuing/returning transactions, user role handling, and admin privileges.
